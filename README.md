- Image to image generation - AI will analyze the uploaded image automatically and transform it into a pixelized version - no need of photo description anymore
- Users can also upload a pixel art version of his / her picture that was generated via other platforms than Retrogram
- Users will have a profile page where they can choose a profile picture and a nickname
- Users can choose also other models than dalle-3
- Users can mark uploaded pictures as public / private and can decide if the pictures will be visible to all users and guests
